# 🧮 C-Calculator

This is my **first C project** — a simple calculator program that runs in the terminal.

## ✨ Features
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division (with divide by zero handling)
- Modulus (integers only)
- Exit option

## 📖 What I Learned
- Using `switch-case` statements in C
- Handling loops (`while`) to make the program run until exit
- Managing different data types (`float` vs `int`)

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Save the code as `calculator.c`
2. Compile using:
   ```bash
   gcc calculator.c -o calculator
