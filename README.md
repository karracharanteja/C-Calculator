# ðŸ§® C-Calculator

This is my **first C project** â€” a simple calculator program that runs in the terminal.

## âœ¨ Features
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division (with divide by zero handling)
- Modulus (integers only)
- Exit option

## ðŸ“– What I Learned
- Using `switch-case` statements in C
- Handling loops (`while`) to make the program run until exit
- Managing different data types (`float` vs `int`)

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Save the code as `calculator.c`
2. Compile using:
   ```bash
   gcc calculator.c -o calculator
3.run the program using:
```bash
./calculator
```
## ðŸ“¸ Sample Output
==== I am a simple calculator ====
1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division
5. Modulus
6. Exit

Choose between 1-6: 1

Enter two numbers: 5 7

The result = 12.00
